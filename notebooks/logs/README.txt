Filenames in this folder follow this pattern:
<METHOD>_<N>C.txt
where
<METHOD> = greedy / heuristic
<N> = 1,2,3 // number of components in a mixture

In 2-3 component experiments,
the first half of simulations corresponds to  variable mixing concentrations 
and constant thetas,
while the second half corresponds to
variable thetas and constant mixing
concentrations = 1/N.
